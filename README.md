# 🇮🇳 Terrorism Trends in India (2000–2020)
### A Data Analysis Project using NumPy, Pandas & Matplotlib

> A data-driven exploratory analysis of terrorism trends in India with a focused study on **cross-border terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir**.

---

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes terrorism-related incidents in India from **2000 to 2020** using data from the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**.

The aim is to understand:
- how terrorism trends evolved over time,
- which years were the deadliest,
- who bore the maximum human cost,
- how attack methods changed,
- and how major militant groups contributed to terrorism in **Jammu & Kashmir**.

---

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
- **Format:** CSV (converted from Excel)
- **Geographic Scope:** India
- **Time Period:** 2000–2020
- **Filtered Rows:** ~10,800+
- **Selected Columns:** 15 (relevant analytical fields)

---

## Key Questions Explored

- 📈 How did terrorism incidents and casualties change over time?
- 📅 Which years experienced the highest impact?
- 👥 Who suffered more — civilians or security personnel?
- 💣 How did attack types evolve?
- 💰 How do trends compare before and after demonetization (2016)?
- 🗺️ Which regions were most affected?
- 🧩 Which groups were most active in cross-border terrorism in J&K?

## 📊 Major Analyses & Findings

### 🔹 1. Overall Terrorism Trends
- Terrorism incidents increased gradually after 2000.
- The **deadliest phase** in terms of human cost was **2006–2010**.
- Casualties show a declining trend toward the late 2010s.

---

### 🔹 2. Peak Years Analysis
- Incident frequency peaks in the mid-2010s.
- Fatalities and injuries peak **earlier**, around 2006–2008.
- High attack frequency does not always imply higher human loss.

---

### 🔹 3. Civilian vs Security Casualties
- **Civilians account for the majority of casualties overall**.
- The period **2006–2010** shows the highest civilian vulnerability.
- A brief rise in security personnel casualties is observed around **2015–2016**.

---

### 🔹 4. Evolution of Attack Types
- **Bombings / Explosions** dominate throughout the dataset.
- Armed assaults and infrastructure attacks increase in the 2010s.
- Most attack types show a **clear decline after 2017–2018**.
- Terrorism evolves gradually rather than changing suddenly.

---

### 🔹 5. Demonetization (2016): Pre vs Post Comparison

**Metrics compared:**
- Incident counts
- Total casualties
- Civilian vs security casualties

**Observations:**
- All metrics are **lower in the post-2016 period (2017–2020)**.
- No immediate drop is observed in 2016.
- The decline appears **gradual**, not abrupt.

---

### 🔹 6. Regional Concentration
- Data-driven ranking identifies the most affected regions.
- States such as **Jammu & Kashmir**, **Chhattisgarh**, **Manipur**, and **Jharkhand** show high activity.
- To avoid mixing internal insurgency with cross-border terrorism, **deep analysis is restricted to Jammu & Kashmir**.

---

### 🔹 7. Group Involvement in Jammu & Kashmir
- A large share of incidents are attributed to **“Unknown” groups**, reflecting attribution limits.
- Among identified groups:
  - **Hizbul Mujahideen (HM)** appears most frequently.
  - **Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)** causes higher human cost per incident.
  - **Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM)** shows episodic but sharp spikes.
- A synchronized surge across groups is observed during **2017–2018**, followed by decline.

---

## Limitations

- GTD is based on open-source reporting; attribution may be incomplete.
- High “Unknown” group counts limit precise group-level conclusions.
- The study does **not establish causal policy effects**.
- Article 370 analysis was excluded due to limited post-event data.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## ✅ Conclusion

This project presents a **structured, data-driven view** of terrorism trends in India over two decades.  
It highlights long-term patterns, evolving tactics, and human cost — with special focus on **cross-border terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir**.

The analysis emphasizes **careful interpretation**, transparency, and analytical discipline when dealing with sensitive security data.
